            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Albert Einstein (1879 – 1955) was a theoretical physicist widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century. He is best known for developing the theory of relativity, which revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and energy.</p>
            <p>Einstein was born in Ulm, Germany, and developed a fascination for science at a young age. His famous equation, E=mc², laid the foundation for nuclear energy, and his contributions to quantum mechanics reshaped modern physics.</p>
